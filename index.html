          <bold>Hi Jo,</bold>
          <p>I've always wished to be with 'someone' that will help me become a better version of myself
          'someone' whose presence will soften my heart and melten my soul and in you I've found that 'someone'.
          Often times I get nervous talking to you, not because I lack words to say to you but because I've countless
          of things I wish to say to you.
          You may not know it but I appreciate every moment we've shared, along the line you became 'someone' I couldn't ignore,
          someone I couldn't hold back from falling for. I'm aware you're not ready for a relationship, but I'm willing to
          to wait... Not because I'm the most patient Man on earth but because I've never been so sure of ever loving anyone this much
          and I'm convinced I want to spend the rest of my life loving you. 
        </p>
